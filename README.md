# Magang-App with React

Website to discover MSIB Internship Batch 6. It was built with ReactJs and Vite. The provided features are filtering by keyword, range of quota, location, and internship partner. It also implement pagination to limit the displayed data per page. It use data that I've gotten by scrapping data from Kampus Merdeka website and then convert it into json file. In other word, it is a redesign user interface from Kampus Merdeka website.

In this project, I used **React** for creating component and state management, **Tailwind css** to styling the web, and **Vercel** for deployment. You can see the preview here:
